Umbraco Jet Social (uJetSocial) is a developer tool for building social applications in Umbraco 7, released as Open Source (MIT).

uJetSocial is built on top of the Umbraco API services layer and accessible through the Umbraco back office. Its roadmap includes social features such as users, groups, blogs, and comments.

## Getting Started
uJetSocial is in its early stages. To get started with uJetSocial, do the following:

1. Download the source code and open it up in VS.
2. Compile and fire up the `Logikfabrik.Umbraco.Jet.Social.Demo` project with IIS Express.
3. Go through the Umbraco installer, and then enable uJetSocial under Users > Users > *your user* > Sections.
4. Refresh (or restart IIS Express) and the uJetSocial section should now be available.
